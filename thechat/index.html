    <h1>The Chat</h1>
    <p>The Chat was a project I made a while ago to test hosting a server with node.js, originally hosted from repl.  The code is incredibly bad, and the program as a whole is very broken.  The source code is currently on display for all to see at <a href="https://github.com/ItsTheChickenMan/thechat">https://github.com/ItsTheChickenMan/thechat</a></p>

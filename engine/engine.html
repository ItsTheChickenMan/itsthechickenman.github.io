    <h2>Bugs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Because of collisions prioritization, if you go up and collide with a block while playerX is less than objectX, you will teleport to the side.  I might fix this, I dunno.</li>
      <li><strike>You can blip out of the screen in the top left corner</strike> Fixed!</li>
      <li>If you're 20 or more times bigger than an object or your speed is too high, you'll probably just go through objects</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I suppose I should also mention that "jumping" results in you defying gravity entirely (this isn't a bug, I just didn't implement a jumping mechanic)</p>

    <h2>Bugs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Because of collisions prioritization, if you go up and collide with a block while playerX is less than objectX, you will teleport to the side.  I might fix this, I dunno.</li>
      <li>Occasionally, you can blip out of the screen</li>
      <li>If you're 10 or more times bigger than an object, you'll most likely go through it unless your speed is low</li>
    </ul>
